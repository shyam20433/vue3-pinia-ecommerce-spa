# E-Commerce Single Page Application (SPA)
live~ https://ecommercepinia.vercel.app/

A modern, responsive E-Commerce web application built using **Vue 3 (Composition API)**, **Vite**, **Vue Router**, and **Pinia** for centralized state management. This project was developed as part of the NGP Internship program.

## 🚀 Features

### 👤 Role-Based Authentication & Navigation
- **Dual Role System**: Supports both **User** and **Admin** profiles.
- **Dynamic Views**: The system updates the UI and navigation options based on the currently logged-in user's role.
- **Protected UI Elements**: The "Manage" tab is restricted to Admins and remains hidden from standard Users.

### 🛍️ Product Catalog
- Interactive grids displaying available products (phones, laptops, accessories, etc.).
- Product information presented in neat, structured tables.
- Access control that prompts users to log in before adding items to the shopping cart.

### 🛒 Cart Management
- Real-time cart state management with Pinia.
- Option to review selected items, display dynamic prices, and delete specific products.
- Router integration that prevents checkout navigation if the cart is empty.

### ⚙️ Admin Operations Dashboard (`/manage`)
- Full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capability for products:
  - **Add Products**: Introduce new items with an ID, name, price, and image URL.
  - **Edit Products**: Update existing items using pre-populated forms.
  - **Delete Products**: Remove single items or clear the entire catalog at once.
- Real-time catalog updates across all views.

### 🎨 Responsive Design & Micro-Animations
- **Mobile First**: Fully responsive layout optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Micro-Animations**: Hover-scale transitions, mechanical press effects on buttons, and smooth sliding underlines on navigation items.
- **Theme**: Crisp white cards, slate gray texts, and bright color-coded action buttons (Blue for primary/edit actions, Green for users, Red for deletes/admins).

## ⚙️ State Management (Pinia Stores)

The application separates state into modular stores inside `src/stores/`:

1. **`auth.js`**: Manages login/logout status and stores the active user object.
   - **Getter**: `isAdmin` computes if the user has administrative privileges based on role flags.
2. **`products.js`**: Houses the initial mock database of products and handles adding or modifying items inside the collection.
3. **`carts.js`**: Controls the items added by the customer and triggers alert feedback upon additions.

---

## 🚦 Router & Guards

The application is structured into the following routes (`src/router/index.js`):
- `/` - **Home View**: Input name and select a profile (User or Admin).
- `/products` - **Product Catalog**: Show catalog grid and cart shortcut buttons.
- `/carts` - **Cart Page**: Review lists of added goods.
- `/manage` - **Management view**: Protected route accessible to Admins only.
- `/about` - **About page**: Informational lazy-loaded chunk.

### 🛡️ Navigation Guard
To provide a smooth user experience, the router has a global guard:
- **Empty Cart Guard**: Restricts navigation to the `/carts` page if the shopping cart is empty, displaying a warning notification and redirecting the client to `/products`.

## 🧩 Shared Components

To maintain consistent styling and behavior, the application relies on reusable UI components:
- [NavBar.vue](file:///src/components/NavBar.vue): Sticky, responsive navigation bar showing active states and welcome banners.
- [AddToCartBtn.vue](file:///src/components/AddToCartBtn.vue): Blue primary button highlighting product selection.
- [adminControlBtn.vue](file:///src/components/adminControlBtn.vue): Grouped Edit and Delete actions designed for management views.
- [backBtn.vue](file:///src/components/backBtn.vue): Slate-styled button with a sliding hover transition for going back.
- [toCartBtn.vue](file:///src/components/toCartBtn.vue): Deep slate action button directing users to the checkout view.
- [removeCrtBtn.vue](file:///src/components/removeCrtBtn.vue): Text-only button that turns red on hover for clean deletion prompts.
